### 🔧 Configuration

1. 📥 Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Crisrod0912/PlushieShop_V2.git
   ```

2. 📂 Open the project folder in Apache Netbeans:

3. 🗄️ Import and execute the database dump:

   Import the `PLUSHIESHOP.sql` file into Oracle. After importing it, execute the script in your database.

4. 🔐 Configure database permissions:

   After importing the database, create a user and grant them the necessary permissions by running the following commands in the Oracle or SQL*Plus console:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER Admin1 IDENTIFIED BY Admin1;
   
   GRANT CONNECT,RESOURCE,DBA TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT CREATE SESSION TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT CREATE TABLE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT CREATE ANY TABLE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT INSERT ANY TABLE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT UPDATE ANY TABLE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT DELETE ANY TABLE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT DROP ANY TABLE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT ALTER ANY TABLE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT CREATE ANY PROCEDURE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT DROP ANY PROCEDURE TO Admin1;
   
   GRANT ALTER ANY PROCEDURE TO Admin1;
   ```

   Replace `'Admin1'` with a more secure password if desired.
